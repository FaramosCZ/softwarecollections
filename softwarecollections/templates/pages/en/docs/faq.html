<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h3>How does a Software Collection differ from a regular package I get from my distribution?</h3>

<p>Since SCLs are distributed as RPMs, it&rsquo;s easy to wonder how they differ. While the installation and format are similar, there are a few important distinctions in SCLs:</p>

<ul>
<li>They do not overwrite or modify system files.</li>
<li>They do not conflict with system files or system software.</li>
<li>They have a unique name, so they do not conflict with upstream software. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Can a Software Collection depend on another Software Collection?</h3>

<p>Yes. If you have an SCL that requires, say, MariaDB, it can depend on that Software Collection. If you&rsquo;re packaging your own SCLs, you can make use of other SCLs rather than having to re-package them within your own SCL. </p>

<h3>How hard is it to create an SCL if I already have the software packaged?</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s not difficult at all. You only need to make minor changes to the spec file, no major surgery is needed on the existing packages. See our Quick Start for more.</p>

<h3>Where can I ask more questions?</h3>

<p>We have a mailing list at <a
