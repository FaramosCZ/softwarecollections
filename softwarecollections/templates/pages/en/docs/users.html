<h1>Software Collections for Users</h1>

<h2>Understanding Software Collections</h2>

<h2>Enabling Software Collections</h2>

<p>To enable support for Software Collections on your system so that you can enable and build Software Collections, you need to have installed the packages scl-utils and scl-utils-build.</p>

<p>If the packages scl-utils and scl-utils-build are not already installed on your system, you can install them by typing the following at a shell prompt as root:</p>

<p><code>yum install scl-utils</code></p>

<p>The scl-utils package provides the scl tool that lets you enable Software Collections on your system. </p>

<p>The scl tool is used to enable a Software Collection and to run applications in the Software Collection environment.</p>

<p>General usage of the scl tool can be described using the following syntax:</p>

<p><code>scl action software_collection_1 software_collection_2 command</code></p>

<h3>Running an Application Directly</h3>

<p>For example, to directly run Perl with the &ndash;version option in the Software Collection named software<em>collection</em>1, execute the following command:</p>

<p><code>scl enable software_collection_1 &#39;perl --version&#39;</code></p>

<p>Alternatively, you can create a wrapper script that shortens the commands for running applications in the Software Collection environment. </p>
